## Current State Assessment

### What We Have Now
- **1,699 geopolitical events** stored in JSON files
- **~414 KB** of data spread across multiple JSON/CSV files
- **Frontend-only processing** - all data loaded into browser memory
- **Manual data validation** via Node.js scripts
- **No database** - pure file-based system

### Why This Works (and Why It Needs to Change)
✅ **Works well for:**
- Current small dataset (1.7K events)
- Single-user/browser-based application
- Simple data structure
- Prototyping phase

❌ **Struggles with:**
- Filtering (must scan all events in memory)
- Scaling beyond 10K events
- Data integrity (manual JSON validation)
- Concurrent access (one browser at a time)
- Complex analytics queries

## Why SQLite is the Right Choice

### SQLite vs Alternatives

| Criteria | SQLite | MongoDB | PostgreSQL | Keep JSON |
|----------|:------:|:-------:|:----------:|:---------:|
| **Setup complexity** | ⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐ |
| **Fits our use case** | ✅✅✅ | ❌ | ⚠️ | ❌ |
| **Performance** | ✅✅✅ | ✅✅ | ✅✅✅ | ❌ |
| **Cost** | 🆓 | 🆓/$ | 🆓 | 🆓 |
| **Scalability** | ~100K events | ∞ | ∞ | ~10K events |
| **Learning curve** | Easy | Medium | Hard | None |
| **Deployment** | Embedded | Server | Server | File only |
| **Our recommendation** | ✅ BEST | ❌ | ⚠️ Later | ❌ No |

---

## What We'll Gain

### 1. Performance (50-100x faster queries)
```
BEFORE: Get all events → Filter in memory → Display
AFTER:  Database filter → Return results → Display
```
- Instant filtering and search
- Sub-100ms response times
- Better user experience

### 2. Scalability (10-100x more events)
```
Current: 1,700 events (~50MB RAM)
Growth: 10,000+ events (still ~50MB RAM with SQLite indexing)
Future: 100,000+ events (PostgreSQL migration path)
```

### 3. Data Integrity (Automatic validation)
```
BEFORE: Manual scripts check data consistency
AFTER:  Database enforces constraints automatically

- Prevents duplicate events
- Ensures required fields
- Validates data types
- Tracks change history
```

### 4. New Capabilities (Features impossible before)
- Full-text search across all events
- Complex analytics and aggregations
- Quality scoring and auditing
- Data lineage tracking
- Concurrent user support

## Implementation Plan (5 Weeks)

```
Week 1: Foundation
  ├─ Set up SQLite database
  ├─ Define schema
  ├─ Migrate existing 1,699 events
  └─ Verify data integrity

Week 2-3: Backend
  ├─ Create Express.js API server
  ├─ Implement CRUD endpoints
  ├─ Add filtering/search
  └─ Performance optimization

Week 3-4: Frontend
  ├─ Create API client layer
  ├─ Update app.js to use API
  ├─ Add lazy loading
  └─ Implement offline caching

Week 4-5: Integration
  ├─ Update data pipeline scripts
  ├─ Quality tracking system
  ├─ Comprehensive testing
  └─ Production deployment
```

### Effort Estimate
- **Development:** 150-200 hours (3-4 weeks)
- **Testing & QA:** 1 week
- **Deployment & Monitoring:** 1 week

### Investment vs Return

**Costs:**
- Development time: 150-200 hours
- Infrastructure: Minimal (embedded database)
- Training: Low

**Returns (Annually):**
- ⚡ 50-100x faster queries (better UX)
- 📈 Support 10-50x more events (growth)
- 🔒 Automated data validation (fewer errors)
- 🎯 New analytics features (value-add)

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Data migration errors | 🔴 High | Automated validation, full backup, testing |
| Downtime during migration | 🟡 Medium | Maintenance window, fallback plan |
| Performance regression | 🟢 Low | Benchmarking before/after |
| API compatibility | 🟡 Medium | Adapter layer, backward compatibility |
| Dependency issues | 🟢 Low | Use well-maintained libraries |

**Overall Risk:** 🟡 **Medium (manageable with proper planning)**

---

## What Stays the Same?

✅ **No changes to user experience** - Same UI, faster performance  
✅ **Same data structure** - Event objects unchanged  
✅ **Same tech stack** - JavaScript, Node.js, Express, vanilla JS  
✅ **Same maps & analytics** - Leaflet.js, Chart.js still work  
✅ **Same deployment** - Can still run locally/on server  

---

## Success Criteria

The migration is successful when:

1. ✅ All 1,699 events migrated with zero data loss
2. ✅ Query performance > 5x improvement
3. ✅ API responds in < 100ms (p95)
4. ✅ Frontend fully functional and responsive
5. ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (>85%)
6. ✅ Documentation complete and updated
7. ✅ Team trained and confident
8. ✅ Production deployment successful

## Questions Answered

### "Is SQLite the right choice?"
✅ **Yes.** Perfect for 1-100K events, embedded usage, ACID compliance needed.

### "How much faster will it be?"
✅ **50-100x faster** for filtered queries (500ms → 5ms).

### "Will it break anything?"
✅ **No.** Can be done with API adapter layer, full backward compatibility.

### "How long will it take?"
✅ **5 weeks** for one developer, full implementation and testing.

### "What if something goes wrong?"
✅ **Safe.** Full JSON backup, rollback plan, staging environment testing first.

### "Will I need to change my code?"
✅ **Minimal.** Frontend gets API client layer, backend gets Express server, same JavaScript.

### "Can we grow to 100K+ events later?"
✅ **Yes.** SQLite supports millions, and if needed, can migrate to PostgreSQL later.
